                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys use all four limbs to walk and run.
They have a coat of hair on most of their bodies.
Many types have bare areas of skin on the face and buttocks.
Male mandrills and some other types have brightly colored skin in these bare areas.</p>
<p>Monkeys live in both mountains and grassy plains.
They have strong tails and can hang, supporting their entire body weight with their tail.
The largest monkey is the Mandrill, while the smallest monkey is a Pygmy Marmoset.
Monkeys are intelligent animals with large brains in relation to their body size.
</p>
<p>They are social animals, usually living in groups and demonstrating complex social behavior.
Most monkeys are omnivores, supplementing a diet of fruit and foliage with a range of small and mid-sized animals.
Most monkeys are arboreal, though some, like macaques and baboons, are terrestrial.
New World monkeys are found in Mexico and South and Central America, while Old World monkeys are found in Asia and Africa.
Many species of monkeys are endangered.</p>
